# MiniMotorwayer: Mini Motorways Automation Bot

A Python-based computer vision pipeline that automates gameplay in *Mini Motorways* using real-time screen analysis and pathfinding algorithms. The system captures screen data, interprets game state via OpenCV, and executes optimal road placements using a custom A* implementation.

## Features
- OpenCV-based screen capture
- A* pathfinding algorithm
- Modular, extensible architecture

## Features To Be Added
- CNN computer vision
- D* pathfinding algorithm
- Fully autonomous gameplay

## Installation
